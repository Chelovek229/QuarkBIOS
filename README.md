**QuarkBIOS is a BIOS that operates in 16-bit real mode and is therefore compatible only with x86 platforms. It is positioned as a young and ambitious project that is just beginning to grow.**

# QuarkBIOS

QuarkBIOS is a 16-bit real-mode BIOS written in x86 assembly. This project is designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate low-level programming techniques.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the BIOS.
- `build/` - Output directory for compiled binaries.
- `docs/` - Documentation for the project.
- `tools/` - Tools and scripts for building and testing.

## Requirements
